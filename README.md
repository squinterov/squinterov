### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate Systems and Computer Engineer and an Artificial Intelligence Specialist (pending degree) from Colombia. My journey spans a wide range of experiences—from software development (vulnerability testing systems) to Deep Learning (multi-agent systems, clustering, and autoencoders).

Driven by curiosity and a love for continuous learning, I enjoy tackling challenging projects and polishing my skills. I also have a strong foundation in networking (CCNA), cybersecurity, and infrastructure (VMware).
